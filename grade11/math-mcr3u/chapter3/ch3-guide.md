**Chapter 3: Quadratic Functions**. Based on these sources, here is a comprehensive guide to help you prepare for your test on **Quadratic Functions**, including key concepts, essential equations, and a study checklist.

### **Important Concepts and Key Ideas**

*   **Properties of Quadratic Functions:** These functions are of degree 2 and their graphs are parabolas. A parabola is symmetric about a vertical line called the **axis of symmetry**, which passes through the **vertex**.
*   **Forms of the Quadratic Function:**
    *   **Standard Form ($f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$):** Useful for identifying the y-intercept ($c$).
    *   **Factored Form ($f(x) = a(x - r)(x - s)$):** Useful for identifying the x-intercepts or zeros ($r$ and $s$).
    *   **Vertex Form ($f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$):** Useful for identifying the vertex $(h, k)$ and the axis of symmetry ($x = h$).
*   **Maximum and Minimum Values:** The y-coordinate of the vertex represents the maximum or minimum value of the function. If $a > 0$, the parabola opens up and has a minimum; if $a < 0$, it opens down and has a maximum.
*   **The Inverse of a Quadratic Function:** The inverse of $f(x) = x^2$ is not a function unless the domain of the original function is restricted (e.g., $x \ge 0$). Graphically, the inverse is a reflection across the line $y = x$.
*   **Operations with Radicals:** An **entire radical** (e.g., $\sqrt{72}$) can be simplified into a **mixed radical** (e.g., $6\sqrt{2}$) by extracting perfect-square factors. You can only add or subtract **like radicals** (those with the same number under the radical sign).
*   **The Discriminant ($b^2 - 4ac$):** This value determines the number of zeros for a quadratic function:
    *   $D > 0$: Two distinct real zeros.
    *   $D = 0$: One real zero (the vertex sits on the x-axis).
    *   $D < 0$: No real zeros.
*   **Families of Parabolas:** A "family" is a group of parabolas that share a common characteristic, such as the same vertex, the same zeros, or the same y-intercept.
*   **Linear-Quadratic Systems:** A line can intersect a parabola at most at two points. Intersection points are found by setting the linear equation equal to the quadratic equation and solving the resulting quadratic.

### **Important Equations, Laws, and Rules**

| Rule/Concept | Equation/Formula |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quadratic Formula** | $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ |
| **Discriminant** | $D = b^2 - 4ac$ |
| **Vertex (from zeros)** | $x = \frac{r + s}{2}$ |
| **Radical Multiplication** | $\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}$ (for $a, b \ge 0$) |
| **Radical Multiplication (Mixed)** | $(c\sqrt{a})(d\sqrt{b}) = cd\sqrt{ab}$ |
| **Inverse Mapping** | Point $(x, y)$ becomes $(y, x)$ |
| **Profit Function** | $P(x) = R(x) - C(x)$ (Revenue - Cost) |
