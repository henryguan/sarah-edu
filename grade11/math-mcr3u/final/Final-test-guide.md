Focus on the following core areas: **Functions and Transformations**, **Equivalent Algebraic Expressions**, **Quadratic and Exponential Models**, and **Trigonometry**.

### 1. Functions and Transformations (Chapters 1 & 6)
The foundation of the course is understanding how different types of functions behave and move.

*   **Function vs. Relation:** A function is a relation where each input ($x$) corresponds to exactly one output ($y$). Use the **Vertical Line Test** on a graph: if any vertical line intersects the curve more than once, it is not a function.
*   **Domain and Range:** The **domain** is the set of all independent values ($x$), and the **range** is the set of all dependent values ($y$).
*   **Parent Functions:** You must recognize the shapes and properties of:
    *   Linear: $f(x) = x$.
    *   Quadratic: $f(x) = x^2$.
    *   Square Root: $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$.
    *   Reciprocal: $f(x) = 1/x$ (has asymptotes).
    *   Absolute Value: $f(x) = |x|$.
*   **Transformations:** For any function $g(x) = af[k(x - d)] + c$:
    *   **$a$:** Vertical stretch/compression. If $a < 0$, reflect in the x-axis.
    *   **$k$:** Horizontal stretch/compression. If $k < 0$, reflect in the y-axis.
    *   **$d$:** Horizontal translation (shift left/right).
    *   **$c$:** Vertical translation (shift up/down).
*   **Inverses:** To find $f^{-1}(x)$, interchange $x$ and $y$ and solve for the new $y$. Graphically, the inverse is a reflection across the line $y = x$.

### 2. Equivalent Algebraic Expressions (Chapter 2)
This section focuses on simplifying and factoring polynomials and rational expressions.

*   **Equivalence:** Two expressions are equivalent if they simplify to the same form or produce the same graph.
*   **Factoring Strategies:** Always look for a **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)** first, then check for **Difference of Squares** ($a^2 - b^2$), **Perfect Square Trinomials**, or **Factoring by Grouping**.
*   **Rational Functions:** These are ratios of two polynomials.
    *   **Restrictions:** You must state values where the denominator equals zero, as the function is undefined there.
    *   **Simplifying:** Factor both the numerator and denominator fully, then divide out common factors.

### 3. Quadratic Functions and Radicals (Chapter 3)
*   **Three Forms of Quadratics:**
    *   **Standard Form:** $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ ($y$-intercept is $c$).
    *   **Factored Form:** $f(x) = a(x - r)(x - s)$ (zeros are $r$ and $s$).
    *   **Vertex Form:** $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ (vertex is $(h, k)$).
*   **Maximum/Minimum:** The optimal value is always the **$y$-coordinate of the vertex**.
*   **Radicals:** A mixed radical is in simplest form when the number under the radical sign is not divisible by any perfect square.
*   **Solving Equations:** Use factoring or the **Quadratic Formula**.

### 4. Exponential Functions (Chapter 4)
*   **Exponent Laws:** Key rules include $b^0 = 1$, $b^{-n} = 1/b^n$, and rational exponents $a^{m/n} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m$.
*   **Growth and Decay:**
    *   Growth: $y = ab^x$ where $b > 1$ (e.g., population growth, interest).
    *   Decay: $y = ab^x$ where $0 < b < 1$ (e.g., radioactive half-life, depreciation).
*   **Asymptotes:** The basic exponential function $f(x) = b^x$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$.

### 5. Trigonometry (Chapters 5 & 6)
*   **Reciprocal Ratios:** Cosecant ($\csc \theta = 1/\sin \theta$), Secant ($\sec \theta = 1/\cos \theta$), and Cotangent ($\cot \theta = 1/\tan \theta$).
*   **Special Angles:** You must know exact values for **$30^\circ, 45^\circ,$ and $60^\circ$**.
*   **CAST Rule:** Identifies which ratios are positive in each quadrant (Quadrant 1: All, 2: Sine, 3: Tangent, 4: Cosine).
*   **Sinusoidal Functions:** Periodic functions like $y = \sin x$ or $y = \cos x$.
    *   **Period:** Length of one cycle ($360^\circ/|k|$).
    *   **Amplitude:** Vertical distance from the axis to a peak or trough.
    *   **Equation of Axis:** $y = (\text{max} + \text{min})/2$.
