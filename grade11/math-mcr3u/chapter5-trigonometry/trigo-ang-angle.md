Here is the original question text, extracted directly from the quiz content:

### Question 1

**Context:** For a terminal arm created by the point $P(-3,-6)$,

* [cite_start]**(a)** Sketch a diagram of this, labeling the principal angle $\theta$ and the related acute angle $\alpha$. [cite: 4]
* **(b)** Determine the exact value of $r$ and then state the exact values of the three primary trig ratios of the angle $\theta$. (reduce radicals and fractions) [cite_start][cite: 11]
* [cite_start]**(c)** Determine $\alpha$ and $\theta$ to 1 decimal place. [cite: 17]

### Question 2

* [cite_start]Determine the exact value of $\sec (210^{\circ})$ by drawing a diagram of the terminal arm on the Cartesian plane, and appropriate special triangle with side lengths and Angles. [cite: 25]

### Question 3

[cite_start]**Context:** For $\cos(A)=-\frac{2}{3},$ where $0^{\circ}\le A\le360^{\circ},$ [cite: 30]

* [cite_start]**(i)** sketch the possible positions of the terminal arms for angle $A$ on the Cartesian plane, [cite: 30]
* [cite_start]**(ii)** determine the exact values of $\tan (A)$, [cite: 30]
* [cite_start]**(iii)** determine all values for $A$ to 1 decimal place. [cite: 30]
