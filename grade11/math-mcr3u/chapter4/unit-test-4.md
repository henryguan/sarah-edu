## 2. Function Properties

For the following function:

$$ y = 2\left(3^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-2)}\right)-4 $$

i) State the base (parent) function $f(x)$.
ii) State the equation of the asymptote.
iii) State the y-intercept.
iv) Write in the form $y=a \cdot f(b(x-c))+d$.

## 4. Application

A computer loses its value each month after it is purchased. Its value (in \$) as a function of time $m$ (in months) is modeled by:

$$ V(m)=1500(0.95)^{m} $$

(a) What is the initial value of the computer? Show mathematically.
(b) What is the rate of depreciation? (Express as a %.)
(c) Determine the value of the computer after 2 years.
(d) In which month after it is purchased does the computer's value fall below \$900?
