Hello! As a fellow math teacher, I completely understand this struggle. Grade 11 is often the year where students "hit the wall" with algebra because they have to apply old skills (factoring) to new, scary-looking terms (trigonometry).

When students see $\sin(x)$, they often stop treating it like a variable. The key is to help them realize that if they can factor $a^2 - a^2b^2$, they can factor $\sin^2x - \sin^2x \cos^2x$.

Here is a set of scaffolded exercises designed to build their confidence, moving from simple integers to more complex variable expressions.

### Part 1: The "Algebra Bridge" (Warm-up)
*Instruction: Factor the following algebraic expressions. Then, look at the trigonometric expression next to it and apply the exact same logic.*

| **A. Algebra Version** | **B. Trigonometry Version** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. $5x - 5$ | 1. $5\sin x - 5$ |
| 2. $-3y + 3$ | 2. $-3\cos x + 3$ |
| 3. $xy + x$ | 3. $\sin x \cos x + \sin x$ |
| 4. $x^2 - x^2y^2$ | 4. $\cos^2 x - \cos^2 x \sin^2 x$ |

### Part 2: Numerical Common Factors
*Goal: Spotting integer coefficients that can be pulled out.*

1.  $4\sin x + 4$
2.  $7\tan x - 7$
3.  $2\cos^2 x + 2\sin^2 x$  *(Great for leading into the Pythagorean identity)*
4.  $-3\sin x - 3$
5.  $10 - 10\cos^2 x$

---

### Part 3: Trigonometric Common Factors (Level 1)
*Goal: Pulling out a single trigonometric function to verify an identity.*

6.  $\sin x \tan x + \sin x$
7.  $\cos^2 x + \cos x$
8.  $\tan x - \tan x \sin^2 x$
9.  $\sin x \cos x - \cos x$
10. $\sec x \tan x + \sec x$

---

### Part 4: Higher Powers & "Hidden" Factors (Level 2)
Goal: Recognizing that $\sin^4 x$  and  $\sin^2 x$ share a common factor of $\sin^2 x$.

11. $\sin^3 x + \sin x$
12. $\cos^4 x - \cos^2 x$
13. $\tan^3 x + \tan^2 x$
14. $\sin^2 x \cos^2 x + \sin^4 x$
15. $\csc^2 x \cot x - \cot x$

---

### Part 5: The "Negative Sign" Trap
Goal: Students often struggle when the leading term is negative. These force them to factor out $-1$ or a negative term.

16. $-\sin^2 x - \cos^2 x$
17. $\cos x - \cos x \sin^2 x$  *(versus)*  $-\cos x + \cos x \sin^2 x$
18. $-5\tan^2 x - 5$
19. $1 - \sin^2 x$ (Challenge: View this as $1(1) - 1(\sin^2 x)$? Or keep as is? This prompts discussion about Difference of Squares vs Common Factors).

### Answer Key (For the Teacher)

**Part 1**
1. $5(\sin x - 1)$
2. $-3(\cos x - 1)$ or $3(1 - \cos x)$
3. $\sin x (\cos x + 1)$
4. $\cos^2 x (1 - \sin^2 x)$

**Part 2**
1. $4(\sin x + 1)$
2. $7(\tan x - 1)$
3. $2(\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x)$ $\rightarrow$ Becomes $2(1) = 2$
4. $-3(\sin x + 1)$
5. $10(1 - \cos^2 x)$ $\rightarrow$ *Becomes $10(\sin^2 x)$*

**Part 3**
6. $\sin x (\tan x + 1)$
7. $\cos x (\cos x + 1)$
8. $\tan x (1 - \sin^2 x)$
9. $\cos x (\sin x - 1)$
10. $\sec x (\tan x + 1)$

**Part 4**
11. $\sin x (\sin^2 x + 1)$
12. $\cos^2 x (\cos^2 x - 1)$ $\rightarrow$ Becomes $\cos^2 x (-\sin^2 x)$
13. $\tan^2 x (\tan x + 1)$
14. $\sin^2 x (\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x)$ $\rightarrow$ Becomes $\sin^2 x (1)$
15. $\cot x (\csc^2 x - 1)$

**Part 5**
16. $-1(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x)$ $\rightarrow$ *Becomes $-1(1) = -1$
17. $\cos x (1 - \sin^2 x)$ and $-\cos x (1 - \sin^2 x)$
18. $-5(\tan^2 x + 1)$ $\rightarrow$ Becomes $-5(\sec^2 x)$

### Teaching Tip:
I often tell my students: "Let $A = \sin x$."
If they get stuck on Exercise #8 ($\tan x - \tan x \sin^2 x$), ask them to write it on a scrap piece of paper as $T - T \cdot S^2$. They usually spot the factor immediately. Then, tell them to "translate it back" to trig.
