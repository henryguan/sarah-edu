## Question 1

Solve the following quadratic equations using the best method (factoring is better than the quadratic formula if factoring is possible).

**(a)** $(2x - 3)(x + 7) = 0$

**(b)** $2x^2 + 2.7x - 5.1 = 0$

**(c)** $2x^2 - 9x - 5 = 0$

---

## Question 2

Simplify:

**(a)** $\sqrt{108}$

**(b)** $4\sqrt{12} - 3\sqrt{48}$

**(c)** $(7\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})(7\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3})$

**(d)** $(3 - 2\sqrt{7})^2$

## Question 3

**(a)** Convert $f(x) = -3(x + 4)^2 + 27$ directly to:
   - (i) Standard form
   - (ii) Factored form

**(b)** State the:
   - (i) $y$-intercept
   - (ii) $x$-intercepts
   - (iii) Vertex
   - (iv) Axis of symmetry
   - (v) Maximum or minimum (state the value)

**(c)** Graph the function (Label and identify key points and axis).

## Question 4

Firas and Ron are playing baseball. Firas pitches the ball to Ron and Ron hits the ball. $t$ seconds after the ball is hit, its height in meters is given by:

$$h(t) = -5t^2 + 20t + 0.8$$

Determine the following:

**(a)** How high was the ball above the ground when it was hit?

**(b)** What is the maximum height of the ball?

**(c)** When will the ball hit the ground?

**(d)** When does the ball have a height of 4 meters?
