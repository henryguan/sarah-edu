# Comprehensive Guide to Transformation Mapping

**Applicable to Ontario Curriculum (MCR3U / MHF4U)**

## 1. The General Theory

Any parent function  can be transformed using the general equation:


### The Pointwise Mapping Formula

To find the new coordinates of any point from the parent function, apply the following rule:


### Parameter Breakdown

Parameter,Transformation Type,Mathematical Action
Parameter,Transformation Type,Mathematical Action
a,Vertical Stretch / Compression / Reflection,Multiply y by a
k,Horizontal Stretch / Compression / Reflection,Divide x by k
d,Horizontal Translation (Phase Shift),Add d to x
c,Vertical Translation,Add c to y

## 2. Quadratic Functions

**Parent Function:** 

**Key Points:** 

### Example: 

* **Identify:** 
* **Mapping Rule:** 

| Parent Point | Calculation | Transformed Point |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | **** (Vertex) |
|  |  | **** |
|  |  | **** |

---

## 3. Exponential Functions

**Parent Function:**  (e.g., )

**Key Points:** 

**Horizontal Asymptote (HA):** 

### Example: 

* **Identify:** 
* **Mapping Rule:** 
* **New Asymptote:** 

| Parent Point | Calculation | Transformed Point |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | **** (-intercept) |
|  |  | **** |

---

## 4. Trigonometric Functions

**Parent Function:** 

**Key Points:** 

### Example: 

* **Identify:** 
* **Mapping Rule:** 

| Parent Point | Calculation | Transformed Point |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | **** (Max) |
|  |  | **** (Midline) |
|  |  | **** (Min) |

## 5. Critical Pro-Tips

1. **Always Factor :** If the equation looks like , you **must** rewrite it as  before identifying .
2. **Order of Operations:** The mapping formula automatically handles the correct order (Stretches/Reflections before Translations).
3. **The -Logic:** Remember that  and  always perform the **inverse** operation of what is written in the bracket. If it says , you add . If it says , you divide by .
