The population of a city is growing at an average rate

of 3% per year. In 1990, the population was 45 000.

a) Write an equation that models the growth of the

city. Explain what each part of the equation

represents.

b) Use your equation to determine the population

of the city in 2007.

c) Determine the year during which the population

will have doubled.

d) Suppose the population took only 10 years to

double. What growth rate would be required for

this to have happened?

### a) Modeling the Growth

To model population growth, we use the general exponential growth formula:


**The Equation:**


**Breakdown of Parts:**

* **:** The final population after  years.
* ** ():** The initial population (the starting value in 1990).
* ** ():** The growth factor. We add the 3% () to 1 (100%) because the population is increasing.
* **:** The number of years since 1990.

### b) Population in 2007

First, we need to find the value of .


Now, substitute  into our equation:


**Answer:** In 2007, the population will be approximately **74,376 people**.

### c) Doubling Time

If the population doubles, the new population will be .

1. Divide both sides by :


2. To solve for an exponent, we use **logarithms**:





**Analysis:** Since  is 1990, we add  to 1990, which gives us .
**Answer:** The population will double **during the year 2013**.

### d) Finding a New Growth Rate

We want the population to double ( initial) in exactly  years. We need to find the new rate .

1. To isolate , take the **10th root** of both sides:



2. Calculate the value:


3. Subtract 1 to find :



**Answer:** To double in 10 years, the growth rate would need to be approximately **7.18%**.

### Teacher's Tips for the Exam:

* **Units:** Always check if the question asks for "the number of years" or "the specific year."
* **Rounding:** Don't round your decimals until the very last step to keep your answer accurate.
* **Logarithms:** If you haven't learned logs yet, you can solve part (c) by using the "guess and check" method on your calculator or by graphing the function.
