# Converting Factored Form to Vertex Form

Converting from Factored Form to Vertex Form is a two-step process. Because the vertex of a parabola is always located exactly halfway between the two x-intercepts, we find the "middle" first and then solve for the height.

## Step 1: Find the x-coordinate of the vertex ($h$)
Since parabolas are perfectly symmetrical, the vertex ($h$) is the midpoint of the two x-intercepts ($r$ and $s$).

**Formula:**
$$h = \frac{r + s}{2}$$

## Step 2: Find the y-coordinate of the vertex ($k$)
Plug the value of $h$ back into the original factored equation to solve for $y$. This result is your $k$.

## Step 3: Write the Vertex Form
Use the same '$a$' value from the factored form and your new $(h, k)$ to write:
$$y = a(x - h)^2 + k$$

## Worked Example
**Convert $y = 2(x - 1)(x - 5)$ to Vertex Form.**

1.  **Identify the x-intercepts:**
    The intercepts are $r = 1$ and $s = 5$. The '$a$' value is $2$.

2.  **Find the midpoint ($h$):**
    $$h = \frac{1 + 5}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$$

3.  **Find the vertex height ($k$):**
    Substitute $x = 3$ into the equation:
    $$y = 2(3 - 1)(3 - 5)$$
    $$y = 2(2)(-2)$$
    $$y = -8$$
    So, the vertex is $(3, -8)$.

4.  **Write in Vertex Form:**
    $$y = 2(x - 3)^2 - 8$$

| Feature | Factored Form: $y=2(x-1)(x-5)$ | Vertex Form: $y=2(x-3)^2-8$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **x-intercepts** | Easily visible ($1$ and $5$) | Hidden |
| **Vertex** | Hidden (requires calculation) | Easily visible $(3, -8)$ |
| **Direction** | Opens Up ($a=2$) | Opens Up ($a=2$) |

## Alternative Method: The "Standard Form" Bridge
If you find the midpoint method confusing, you can also:
1.  Expand the factored form into Standard Form ($y = ax^2 + bx + c$).
2.  Complete the Square to reach Vertex Form.

> **Note:** However, the midpoint method shown above is usually much faster and results in fewer calculation errors!
