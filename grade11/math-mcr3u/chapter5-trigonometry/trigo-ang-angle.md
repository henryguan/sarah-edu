### Question 1

For a terminal arm created by the point $P(-3,-6)$,

* **(a)** Sketch a diagram of this, labeling the principal angle $\theta$ and the related acute angle $\alpha$.
* **(b)** Determine the exact value of $r$ and then state the exact values of the three primary trig ratios of the angle $\theta$. (reduce radicals and fractions) \
r= \
$Sin(\theta)$ \
$Cos(\theta)$ \
$Tan(\theta)$

* **(c)** Determine $\alpha$ and $\theta$ to 1 decimal place.

### Question 2

Determine the **exact** value of $\sec (210^{\circ})$ by drawing a diagram of the terminal arm on the Cartesian plane, and appropriate special triangle with side lengths and Angles.

$\sec (210^{\circ})$ = 

***

### Question 3

For $\cos(A)=-\frac{2}{3}$, where $0^{\circ}\le A\le360^{\circ},$

* **(i)** sketch the possible positions of the terminal arms for angle $A$ on the Cartesian plane,
* **(ii)** determine the exact values of $\tan (A)$,
* **(iii)** determine all values for $A$ to 1 decimal place.
